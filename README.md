## Education
- Ph.D., Machine Learning and Medical Genomics, Université Paris Cité, France (_Dec 2024_)								       		
- M.S., Applied Mathematics, Havana University, Cuba (_Oct 2020_)	 			        		
- B.S., Computer Science, Havana University, Cuba (_Jul 2017_)

## Work Experience
**PhD. research student @ Institut Imagine, Paris, France (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- Adapted the bioinformatics pipelines for the clinical annotation of genetic variants to be trained through Federated Learning (a decentralised Machine learning technique that protects data privacy).
- Improved the performance of previous models by 3%, while increasing the security and privacy of patient data.

**SQL developer @ Liberty Power, Florida, USA (_March 2021 - May 2021_)**
- Developed SQL procedures to clean and update the databases of the company.
- Implemented tests for verifying the integrity of the data stored in the databases

**AI Research Engineer @ Institute of Cybernetics Mathematics and Physics, Havana, Cuba (_September 2017 - February 2021_)**
  - Implemented a machine learning-based model for the pathogenicity annotation of breast masses in mammography images, through the analysis of image texture. The model achieved an accuracy of 92%.
  - Implemented a model based on semantic segmentation through Mask-RCNN for the automatic identification of diabetes foot ulcers in images. The model aimed at assisting clinician in Cuban hospitals in analysing the healing of the ulcer.

**Data Scientist @ Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havane, Cuba (_January 2017 - July 2017_)**
  - Integrated the spontaneous reporting system of the FDA to the local databases of the center.
  - Developed a machine-learning model based on Random Forest trained on biological, chemical, and phenotypical descriptors for the annotation of drug-drug interactions.
